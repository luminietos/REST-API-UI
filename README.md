# REST-API UI
A Node.js REST API application with five different routes. 

## Description
This is a REST API application (with front-end styling/layout) created in April 2023. 


## Step-by-step guide - *"How do I actually use this site?"*
Under construction, please hold.

## Purpose
This is the third of the three projects (first being [a Node.js Guestbook](https://github.com/luminietos/GB) and the second technically being the first part to this project: [REST API routes] without the UI I'm making in this one) I created for my University's Full Stack course. 

Note: Technically, while I'm counting this as its own project like my course, it's simultaneously just continuation to the aforemntioned [second REST API project](https://github.com/luminietos/REST-API). In this project, I add the front-end styling and layouts to what I coded previously. Some minor changes to the back-end may also occur, should the situation require it.   

Technically, the third project is a continuation of this project, as I simply create a UI for the code I have here. However, for clarity, the 'third project' (or project 2.2, really) is [in its own, separate repository](https://github.com/luminietos/REST-API). Much of the same code will be used for obvious reasons.  

## Status
The development of this project is ongoing.
